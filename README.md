# μρπ (miropi)
MIDI Router on Raspberry Pi

Work in progress.

## Hardware
- Raspberry Pi: tested and developed on Pi Zero, so any regular Pi should work. Pi Pico version is a long-term goal, probably will need rewriting everything
- Screen: ssd1306 128x64
- 7 buttons: 5-way navigation, escape key, options key
- USB hub, so you can connect multiple MIDI devices: either Raspberry Pi USB Hub Hat or a regular USB hub. Getting a independently powered one is recommended
